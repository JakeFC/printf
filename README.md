_PRINTF

This project is a recreation of the standard function "printf"

The variables used come from a preconstructed list supplied by Holberton curriculum.
The man page can be reached within this directory using the shell script "man ./man_3_printf"

Built using Linux Ubuntu 14.0.4

General use test:
The program functions on a basis of printf [format] [argument]. When written, it reads as printf("%format", arg);
'printf("%i", 16)' will supply you with a standard out of 16, given that the argument is an integer.
